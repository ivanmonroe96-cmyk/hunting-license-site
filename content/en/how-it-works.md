# How It Works

**Our step-by-step service (summary):**

1. **Initial contact & document check** — You send us your ID and required documents; we review and note any missing items.
2. **Registration with a suitable hunting school** — We select an approved school in your area or country and register you.
3. **Document management** — We fill out forms, translate if needed, and upload everything to the school.
4. **Exam preparation** — We provide study materials and sample questions; optional: 1-on-1 tutoring.
5. **Exam date & follow-up** — We book your exam and support you administratively until you receive your license.

**Important:** We work only legally and transparently. We do *not* buy hunting licenses — we manage and simplify the legal registration and exam process.
